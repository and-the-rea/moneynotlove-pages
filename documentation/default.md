#### introduction

moneynotlove uses the [grav CMS](https://getgrav.org). This is a light-weight, flat-file, easy-to-manage system for creating websites. It is well documented and has an active community.

If you want to edit the content, you need to get to know the following underlining frameworks:
- markdown https://learn.getgrav.org/content/markdown
- yaml frontmatter https://learn.getgrav.org/content/headers
- the grav cms page structure https://learn.getgrav.org/content/content-pages

If you want to develop the theme further, you need to know about:
- twig template language http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/2.x/advanced.html
- our flexbox grid http://www.meetsally.com
