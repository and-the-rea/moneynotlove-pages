# New Year

date: end March

place: konamy Atelier, Sihlquai 125, 8005 ZÃ¼rich

At this intimate event, we will discuss the most burning concerns of creatives in the Zurich Area, to which moneynotlove could contribute. As an outcome, we hope to have a small list of issues. The content of this list is not defined yet, as we want to get input from practitioners in the field. The outcome will be used to define the next event.

Maybe the list could include:
- more extended information regarding
  - insurance
  - intellectual property rights
- peer review of work
- excursions to manufacturers or studios
- discussions of the role of design
- how design contributes to a better world
- design for government, urban labs
